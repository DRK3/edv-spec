        <h3>Ecosystem Overview</h3>

        <p>
This section describes the roles of the core actors and the relationships
between them in an ecosystem where this specification is expected
to be useful. A role is an abstraction that might be implemented in many
different ways. The separation of roles suggests likely interfaces and
protocols for standardization. The following roles are introduced in this
specification:
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt>storage agent</dt>
          <dd>
A role an <a>entity</a> might perform by
          </dd>
          <dt>storage provider</dt>
          <dd>
A role an <a>entity</a> might perform by

      <section>
        <h3>Discovering Service Endpoints</h3>

        <p>
A website may provide service endpoint discovery by embedding JSON-LD in their
top-most HTML web page (e.g. at <code>https://example.com/</code>):
        </p>

        <pre class="example highlight" title="Example of HTML-based service description">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html>
&lt;html lang="en">
  &lt;head>
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8">
    &lt;title>Example Website&lt;/title>
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
    &lt;script src="script.js">&lt;/script>
    &lt;script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://w3id.org/data-hubs/v1",
  "id": "https://example.com/",

  &lt;body>
    &lt;!-- page content -->
  &lt;/body>
&lt;/html>

        <p>
Service descriptions may also be requested via content negotiation.
In the following example a JSON-compatible service description is provided
(e.g. <code>curl -H "Accept: application/json" https://example.com/</code>):
        </p>

        <pre class="example highlight" title="Example of a JSON-based service description">

        <h2>Creating a Data Hub</h2>

        <p>
A data hub is created by performing an HTTP POST of a
<a href="#datahubconfiguration">DataHubConfiguration</a>
to the <code>dataHubCreationService</code>. The following HTTP
status codes are defined for this service:
        </p>

        <table class="simple">
          <thead>
            <th style="white-space: nowrap">HTTP Status</th>

          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>201</td>
              <td>
Data hub creation was successful. The HTTP <code>Location</code> header will
contain the URL for the newly created ledger.
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>400</td>
              <td>
Data hub creation failed.
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>409</td>
              <td>
A duplicate data hub exists.
              </td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>
An example exchange of a data hub creation is shown below:

        <pre class="example highlight" title="Data hub creation request">

        </pre>

        <p>
If the creation of the data hub was successful, an HTTP 201 status code is
expected in return:

    <h2>Security Considerations</h2>

    <p>
There are a number of security considerations that implementers should be
aware of when processing data described by this specification. Ignoring or
not understanding the implications of this section can result in
security vulnerabilities.
    </p>

    <p>
While this section attempts to highlight a broad set of security
considerations, it is not a complete list. Implementers are urged to seek the
advice of security and cryptography professionals when implementing mission
critical systems using the technology outlined in this specification.

    <h2>Accessibility Considerations</h2>

    <p>
There are a number of accessibility considerations implementers should be
aware of when processing data described in this specification. As with any web
standards or protocols implementation, ignoring accessibility issues makes
this information unusable to a large subset of the population. It is important
to follow accessibility guidelines and standards, such as [[WCAG21]], to ensure
all people, regardless of ability, can make use of this data. This is
especially important when establishing systems utilizing cryptography, which
have historically created problems for assistive technologies.

This section details the general accessibility considerations to take into

  <section class="informative">
    <h2>Internationalization Considerations</h2>

    <p>
There are a number of internationalization considerations implementers should be
aware of when publishing data described in this specification. As with any web
standards or protocols implementation, ignoring internationalization makes it
difficult for data to be produced and consumed across a disparate set of
languages and societies, which would limit the applicability of the
specification and significantly diminish its value as a standard.

This section outlines general internationalization considerations to take into
